## About

Front-end SPA web3 of a NFT collection. I created this website with some cripto-yuppies, already listed at [opensea.io](https://opensea.io/collection/yuppie90s-collection), with the main purpose to try and test main 3rd web features.

## Features

### Login with metamask
Well, this is the main feature and aim of this website, eliminate the always used login with user and email and use a web3 login method like connecting your metamask ID to this website.

## Roadmap
* Mobile-first reponsive
* Change view dependeing on logged in or not with metamask
* I have always wanted to use Framer Motion linbrary and this is the perfect project to do so.
